# Country Complexity Rankings 1995 - 2021

# Schema

**Country: The name of the country.**

**ECI Rank 1995 - 2021:** 
The country's rank is based on the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) for each year from 1995 to 2021. The ECI is a holistic measure of the production characteristics of large economic systems, usually cities, regions, or countries. Typically, economically diversified and sophisticated countries have higher ECI values.

**COI Rank 1995 - 2021:** The country's rank is based on the Complexity Outlook Index (COI) for each year from 1995 to 2021. The COI indicates the potential for future growth and economic development.

# Exploratory data analysis
The dataset spans from 1995 to 2021, inclusive.
The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and Complexity Outlook Index (COI) ranks are provided for each country and each year. A lower rank indicates a higher complexity or outlook.
